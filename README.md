# 🧠 AI in Software Engineering – Week 4 Assignment

**Theme:** Building Intelligent Software Solutions 💻🤖

This project demonstrates how **Artificial Intelligence (AI)** can enhance software engineering processes — from automation and predictive analytics to ethical evaluation. It includes theoretical insights, practical implementations, and an innovative AI tool proposal.

---

## 📚 **Project Overview**

The assignment explores three major areas:

1. **Theoretical Analysis:** Understanding AI-driven tools, supervised vs. unsupervised learning, and ethical AI applications.
2. **Practical Implementation:**
   - AI-powered code completion
   - Automated testing using Selenium or Testim.io
   - Predictive analytics using machine learning models (Random Forest)
3. **Ethical Reflection:** Examining dataset biases and fairness in AI deployment.
4. **Bonus Innovation Task:** Designing an AI tool proposal — _CodeNarrate AI_ — for automated documentation generation.

## 🚀 **Implementation Summary**

### 🔹 Task 1: AI-Powered Code Completion

- Used GitHub Copilot to suggest Python code for sorting a list of dictionaries.
- Compared AI-generated and manually written code.
- Found AI’s version more optimized and readable for general use.

### 🔹 Task 2: Automated Testing

- Automated login test cases with Selenium IDE.
- Captured success/failure screenshots.
- Demonstrated how AI-driven testing expands test coverage and reduces human error.

### 🔹 Task 3: Predictive Analytics for Resource Allocation

- Used **Kaggle Breast Cancer Dataset**.
- Preprocessed data and trained a **Random Forest Classifier**.
- Evaluated performance using **Accuracy** and **F1-score**.
- Identified top predictive features like `radius_mean`, `concavity_mean`, and `area_worst`.

---

## 🤖 **Ethical Reflection**

- Highlighted potential biases in datasets (e.g., underrepresented teams or skewed data).
- Proposed using **IBM AI Fairness 360** to detect, evaluate, and mitigate such biases.
- Emphasized the importance of fairness, transparency, and inclusivity in AI-driven decisions.

---

## 💡 **Bonus Task: CodeNarrate AI**

**CodeNarrate AI** is an AI-powered documentation generator designed to:

- Automatically summarize and explain codebases.
- Generate structured Markdown/HTML documentation.
- Update docs continuously through GitHub integration.

✨ _Impact:_ Saves developer time, improves maintainability, and enhances onboarding efficiency.
